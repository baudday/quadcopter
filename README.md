This project contains everything needed to build a quadcopter from scratch!

# You will need
* Arduino Mega
* [Arduino Mega protoshield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9346)
* [Sparkfun 9DOF Sensor Stick](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10724). You can get away with just the [ITG-3200](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11977),
but this will change the layout of the controller a bit and you won't have the accelerometer/magnetometer available for use later on if you so choose.
* Some ESC's, Brushless motors, propellers, and a LiPo battery. You'll have to do some research on this and put together the setup that best suits your needs.
* A transmitter/receiver (I use the Turnigy 9X)
* [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/download) for the frame design
* [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/download/) for the controller schematic/layout

# What's included
* Simple frame design that can be built quickly/cheaply
* Schematic and board layout for the flight controller
* Code! Written with the help of this [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFxqFQwRumc&list=PL0K4VDicBzsibZqfa42DVxC8CGCMB7G2G)
